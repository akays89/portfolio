# portfolio
I created a portfolio webpage to using html and css to showcase my coding work.
I had to use stock photos as place holders for my work at this time.
In the future I hope to update this with projects I have done and also using new skills that I have learned.
This will be a great tool when looking for a job in the field to show my abilities.
